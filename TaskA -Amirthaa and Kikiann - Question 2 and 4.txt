Question 2:
For this sensor I would suggest using the third model y=ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d. If you take a look at the graphs and R2_score you can see that in the third graph the regression line is going through all the points. The R2_score for this model is also the closest to number 1. The R2_score is 0.9998. For the other models the regression line does not completely go through all the scatter points. Also the R2_score is not as close to 1.

Question 4:
a. The r values are: 
    r = 5
    r = 15
    r = 25
    r = 35
    r = 45
    4 = 55
b. In order to be able to perform a face recognition I would suggest to use r = 35 or r= 45. The more values are used the more you get to the original photo. But with r = 35 it is possible to recognize the people on the photo.
c. In order to only recognize black and bright spots in the picture, I would choose r = 5. With this value you can barely recognize the forms on the picture, but you can recogzine the black and bright spots.
d. To be able to recognize forms in the picture, I would use r = 15. With this value it is possible to recognize the forms in the picture, in this case people. 
e. Other methods that can be used to perform image compression without losing too much information are:
    - Fractal compression
    - RLE (Run- Length Encoding)
    - DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)
    - Chain code
    - Chroma subsampling
    - Reducing the color space to the most common colors on the image.
